Problem Statement: 
Project Management Tool


Build an application that will be used as an online project management tool where the users can maintain their project by adding specifications, scheduling tasks, assigning the tasks to the team members etc.


Following will be the features that can be implemented to build the application:


Create a tool for an online project management where the users need to register with their mail id and create their password or the user can sign up with their Google Account.


Once logged in, users will be able to create projects with Project name in a text field and save it. Multiple projects can be created with a ‘plus’ icon to add projects.


After the project is created it will be listed under a tab called Project. Selecting a specific project it will open in a new tab to its respective dashboard.


The project dashboard will have three different panels in separate columns format. The different panels are Current Iteration, Backlog & Icebox. The panels can be closed with the ‘X’ cross icon. Once closed the panel can be opened from the left side navigation.


Under each of the panels there will be an option to add the project features with a button named ‘+Add feature’. Clicking on it will expand a form to write the title in a text field, description in a text area to brief the feature more. Another section will be there to add tasks.


On creating a new feature, the system should create an auto-generate ticket id for the feature identification.


There should be a Search Bar where by searching with the ticket id number or the title of the feature or any relevant keyword search, it should show the results accordingly.


Add a Text field to add more tasks under one feature which will be there with a checkbox option in each of the tasks to mark the specific task as done and add buttons beside each of them. Hitting on enter should get saved as well.


With each of the features, attachment can be added for image, documents or (JPG/PNG), DOCS, PDF, XLS etc.


There should be a dropdown option to assign the task to the members who have an account. The dropdown will have filters to type and search the name of the members for easy filtration.


Task count should be shown besides the task in brackets [For Example: (3/5)] with total number of added tasks and number of tasks marked as completed.


There will be a comment box with a text area below each of the tasks for internal communication. In the comment box, members can be mentioned by “@” and the name of the member to highlight it.


There will be a task status option with the following functions like Started, Finished, Delivered.


On each status change and comments by the users, it should send an email notification to the respective team members' mail id and also the notification should be shown in the user account dashboard with the count.
